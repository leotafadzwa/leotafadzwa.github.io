## About me

I am a data science enthusiast who is motivated by the applications of artificial intelligence in solving world problems. An open minded individual who is willing to learn new things and enjoys telling stories with data. I hold a Bsc in Statistics and Financial Mathematics and i'm currently studying Msc in Data Analytics. I am currently [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/) ambassador. Zindi is the first and largest community of African data scientists with the objective of solving the world's most pressing challenges using artificial intelligence and machine leaning. I am also a team lead at  [Data Science Zimbabwe](https://zimbabwedata.science/about/about.html). 

## Projects
### 1. [Opening a Food Outlet in Harare, Zimbabwe](https://github.com/leotafadzwa/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Capstone-Course)
Harare has quite a few number of restaurants which includes Chinese, Indian, Western and Traditional. The restaurant business provides a good business opportunity considering that Harare is home to approximately 1.5 million people. Opening a new restaurant requires serious consideration and there are a lot of factors to consider, which might be very complicated sometimes. Particularly, the location of the place is one of the most important decisions that will determine the success of the business. The objective of this project is to analyze and select the best neighborhood in the city of Harare to open a new food restaurant using data collected through the Foursquare API.

### 2. [COVID-19 Classifier](https://github.com/leotafadzwa/Covid_19_image_classification-CNN-/)
COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Since then, the virus has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is then critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients.Application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialised physicians in Zimbabwe. The aim of this project is to build a classifier to automatically detect COVID‚Äê19 patients using chest xray images

### 3. [Runmila AI Institute Tuberculosis Classification](https://github.com/leotafadzwa/Runmila-AI-Institute-Tuberculosis-Classification-baseline)
The objective of this challenge is to build an AI model that can classify Tuberculosis and Normal X-Ray results. With Tuberculosis infections still active as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an automated tool to help identify TB has the potential to reduce hospital workload and optimize patient care during a time when hospitals are being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.

### 4. [Flood-Prediction-in-Malawi](https://github.com/leotafadzwa/Flood-Prediction-in-Malawi-using-h2o)
The Malawi Flood Prediction Challange was hosted by Zindi from 2 December 2019 to 18 May 2020. The objective is to build a machine learning model that helps predict the location and extent of floods in southern Malawi.
